# biostat-tfl-compare
This R Shiny app enables comparison of statistical outputs in RTF format, supporting both: (1) File level: side-by-side comparison of two RTF files with detailed HTML diff reports. (2) Folder level: bulk comparison of two directories, matching files with the same name and highlighting differences in content, structure, or formatting.
